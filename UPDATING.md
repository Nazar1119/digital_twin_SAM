# Updating 15.03

## Overview
This update introduces new experimental changes to the project, focusing on adjustments to the SAM parameters and improvements in histogram logic. Additionally, a new calculation for the circumference diameter of a single agglomerate is implemented.

## Changes & Improvements
- **Experimenting with SAM parameters** to refine processing accuracy.
- **Modified histogram logic** to enhance data representation.
- **Implemented circumference diameter calculation**:
  - Uses the **Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR)** method.
  - Determines the **diameter of a single agglomerate**.
  - Displays each calculated diameter in the histogram.
